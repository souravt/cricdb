  - Full name and photo.
  - Personal details (age, nationality, height, etc.).
  - Career details (teams played for, debut date, current status).
  - Statistics (matches played, runs scored, wickets taken, etc.).
  - Achievements and awards.

### **2.3 Matches Played**
- For each cricketer, the app should display:
  - A list of matches played, including details like:
    - Date
    - Opponent team
    - Venue
    - Match type (Test, ODI, T20, etc.)
  - Performance in the match (e.g., runs scored, wickets taken).

### **2.4 Similar Profiles**
- Provide a list of similar cricketers based on:
  - Playing role.
  - Performance metrics (e.g., batting average, strike rate, bowling economy).
  - Team and era.

### **2.5 Similar Matches**
- Suggest matches similar to the ones played by the cricketer based on:
  - Match format (Test, ODI, T20).
  - Opponent team and venue.
  - Match performance (e.g., standout performances by cricketers).

## **3. Non-Functional Requirements**

### **3.1 Performance**
- Search results should load within 2 seconds.
- Profiles and match details should load within 3 seconds.

### **3.2 Scalability**
- The application should support up to 1 million users and a database of 10 million cricketer profiles and match records.

### **3.3 Usability**
- The UI should be intuitive and mobile-friendly.
- Provide filters and sorting options for search results.

### **3.4 Security**
- Use secure authentication methods for admins.
- Encrypt sensitive data such as user credentials and API keys.

### **3.5 Data Integrity**
- Ensure the accuracy and consistency of cricketer and match data.
- Implement data validation for all input fields.

## **4. Technical Requirements**

### **4.1 Frontend**
- Framework: React, Angular, or Vue.js.
- Mobile compatibility: Responsive design with support for iOS and Android.

### **4.2 Backend**
- Language: Python (Django/Flask) or Node.js.
- API: REST or GraphQL for communication between frontend and backend.

### **4.3 Database**
- Primary storage: PostgreSQL or MySQL for structured data.
- Vector database: Milvus, Pinecone, or FAISS for similarity search (e.g., similar profiles and matches).

### **4.4 Search Engine**
- ElasticSearch or OpenSearch for efficient searching and filtering.

### **4.5 Hosting**
- Cloud platform: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
- Services: Load balancer, CDN, and database hosting.

## **6. Future Enhancements**
- Add player comparison features (e.g., compare statistics of two cricketers).
- Provide real-time match updates and notifications.
- Integrate machine learning to predict similar profiles/matches more accurately.
- Allow users to create and save favorite player lists.

---

## **7. Assumptions and Constraints**

Based on your requirements, I'll create a high-level architecture diagram for the Cricketers Profile Application. The design will include the key components, such as the frontend, backend, database, search engine, and integration services. Here's a textual outline of the architecture:

---

### **Architecture Overview**
1. **Frontend**:
   - Technology: React, Angular, or Vue.js
   - Features: 
     - Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
     - Pages for search, profile view, match history, and similar profiles/matches.
     - Authentication UI for admin access.
     - Filtering and sorting options.

2. **Backend**:
   - Technology: Python (Django/Flask) or Node.js.
   - Features:
     - REST or GraphQL API for communication with the frontend.
     - Data processing and integration with external cricket data APIs.
